"""Plan-phase planner — sub-agent team mode (atelier#58).

Design refs: §5.4 (wave-based dispatch is mandatory; `parallel_group` not null),
§17 (sub-agent-mode plan phase = parallel specialist reads + planner synthesis),
§7.3/§17 failure semantics.

The plan phase runs in two orchestration waves (built by the PM's `Agent`
dispatches — this module CANNOT spawn agents):

  * **Wave 0 — parallel specialist reads.** The PM infers 3-7 specialist
    personas and dispatches them in parallel; each writes a field-analysis doc
    to the durable backend (``domain=research, subdomain=field-analysis``). See
    ``internal/plan-wave-0/SKILL.md``.
  * **Wave 1 — planner synthesis.** A single planner sub-agent consolidates the
    spec + field-analysis docs into a task list. See
    ``internal/plan-wave-1/SKILL.md``.

This module is the *deterministic backend* for wave 1: it parses the synthesis
agent's emitted task list, gates it, and persists it. The agent dispatch is
injected as the ``synthesize`` callable so the control flow is unit-testable
without spawning agents.

Failure semantics (§17 locked rule + #58 acceptance):

  * **SYNTHESIS-FAILURE** — the synthesis agent produced no parseable task list
    (empty / not JSON / not a non-empty list). There is nothing to correct, so
    escalate immediately with **no auto-retry** (§17: "synthesis-failure →
    one-shot escalate, no auto-retry").
  * **DAG-INVALID** — a well-formed list was produced but fails a deterministic
    gate (null ``parallel_group`` per §5.4, or ``dag.validate_dag``). This is a
    fixable defect, so the planner gets **exactly ONE re-prompt-to-fix retry**
    (the validator message is fed back to the synthesis agent), then escalates
    (#58: "planner re-synthesizes on a single DagValidationError before giving
    up"). The retry counter and escalation live HERE (deterministic), not in
    the SKILL markdown.

Reviewer-disjointness enforcement (§5.2/§19) is sibling **#59** — intentionally
NOT enforced in this module. The PM-side wave dispatch loop is sibling **#60**.

    implement task it reviews — a persona cannot impartially grade its own work
    (the integrity guarantee behind A4/P2/F9).

    A review task declares ``reviews: "<task_id>"`` (a SINGLE string naming the
    implement task it reviews); non-review tasks omit the key (``None``).
    ``reviews`` is validation-time-only metadata, NOT persisted — like
    ``depends_on``/``reads``/``writes``. (Wave-ordering — a review running after
    the work it reviews — is ORTHOGONAL: the synthesis prompt declares
    ``depends_on: [reviewed]`` on review tasks and ``dag.validate_dag``'s
    existing acyclic/wave gates enforce it. This gate is persona-only.)

      1. ``reviews`` shape — must be a non-empty ``str`` (or absent/``None`` =
         not a review task). A non-str / empty value is rejected.
      2. self-reference — ``reviews == own task_id`` is rejected.
      3. orphan — ``reviews`` must name an in-list ``task_id``.
      4. persona-disjointness — both the reviewer's and the reviewed task's
         ``assigned_persona`` must be present (a missing one is a DEFECT, not
         "disjoint"), and they must DIFFER (exact-string compare on the
